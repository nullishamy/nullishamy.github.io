As GenAI pushes itself further into our lives, it is only natural that its users evolve its scope and use it more and more. You have to ask yourself, though, is it really the right choice?

To set the scene, I was applying for further education. As a part of this, since I was doing advanced entry (skipping parts of the course), I had to write various documents and presentations proving that I was capable of the workload that my intended entrypoint would throw at me.
As I was doing it through my employer, they also had to write a small summary highlighting why I am a good fit for the module. This is where the issue lies.

I wrote out my section of the document, handed it over, and got a reply near instantly. Rather suspicious. A quick skim of their answer showed what I expected, that they had used Copilot to shit out a half-truth summary of my skills and expertise, and a load of waffle about why I was a good fit. 

This hurt. It was in this moment that I really had a reality check on the applicability of these technologies, the insincerity to not even write the summary yourself. It highlighted to me the importance of _the human touch_, the value of writing something yourself, and giving it your own little style.

Whilst the generated summary was _fine_, it wasn't anything special, it was cookie cutter bullet points with drawn out explanations, with little to no practical examples to really show off the skills I've worked hard on. Of course, I had to edit it in parts due to bad phrasing, grammar, etc, as the generator hadn't done any of that.

Something worth keeping in mind as we deal with this technology on a more regular basis. How would _you_ feel if you knew an important/sensitive message wasn't even human.
