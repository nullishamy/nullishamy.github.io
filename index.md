## Welcome to my blog

I will be posting occasional blog posts on interesting programming & tech related topics here. 

At the minute, I have nothing planned, though as I continue to develop my [JVM](https://github.com/nullishamy/JVM) I will have many articles to write regarding Rust, LLVM, and JVM development in general.

This site is hosted on GitHub pages for its easy of use, [lack of] cost, and low maintenance nature.
